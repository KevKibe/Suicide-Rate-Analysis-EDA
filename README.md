# Suicide Rate Analysis EDA
Context<br>
Close to 800 000 people die due to suicide every year, which is one person every 40 seconds. Suicide is a global phenomenon and occurs throughout the lifespan. Effective and evidence-based interventions can be implemented at population, sub-population, and individual levels to prevent suicide and suicide attempts. There are indications that for each adult who died by suicide there may have been more than 20 others attempting suicide.

# Objective<br>
The objective of this case study is to find the patterns for increased suicide rates among different cohorts globally, across the socioeconomic spectrum by using exploratory data analysis.

# Data Dictionary<br>
